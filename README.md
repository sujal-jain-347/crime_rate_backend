The backend of the crime rate project an (web app), written in the python flask framework ,
it can be deploy independently as there is the server side scripting (with little changes),
or with the frontend which is the repository,
there are ML models which are the static in the nature of the each state and the cirme,
the datasets of the crime is also there,  

Crime is one of the biggest and dominating problem in our
society. Daily there are huge number of crimes committed
frequently. In our project we use the dataset of the past
committed crime as an input and predict the rate of crime in
the future by the use of the machine learning concepts which
will helps the government for making policy for the
prevention of crime and public by making them aware of the
crime happenings surround them.

Here we have use the :
python
flask
mongodb

in earlier version i have built this website as the server side rendering website i.e server will genrate the html but since i have made the it such that server will only need to send the  required data so the much of the jinja/html , css , bootstrap code is not in use but if some want to use then can do it by some simple changes , the all requires file are there

for running the website just do pip install requirements.txt and run it

The website image is given as :

I hope that Crime rate prediction app will help the law
makers for making the effective criminal policy for
prevention of the crime, public by making them
aware of the crime happenings surround them,
significantly enhance the police patrolling by
making them more targeted and pro active,
can be used by the criminologists for research
and academics purpose. It will provide the
prediction crime rate, choropleth mapping of
crime, data visualization, predictive insights
